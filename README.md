## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
**itsme-Awanish/itsme-Awanish**
<p>ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning MLop and trying to get hands-on with certain Python packages like Zenml</p>
<p>ðŸ’¬ If you want to suggest something like a project or repository so that I can learn it quickly, feel free to message me</p>
<p>âš¡ Fun fact: real code is something that humans can also understand, not just machine</p>
***
<p>ðŸ¤” last but not least, Iâ€™m looking for job openings. Also, I want some professional ground to get industry-level experience</p>
